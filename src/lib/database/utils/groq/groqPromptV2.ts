**Evaluation Criteria**:

1. **Overall Resume Assessment**:
   - Provide a high-level summary of the resume’s strengths, areas for improvement, and alignment with industry standards.

2. **Content Relevance and Structure**:
   - **Structure Compliance**: Evaluate the structure based on experience level. For recent graduates, ensure sections such as Education, Skills, and Projects follow Work Experience. For experienced candidates, ensure Work Experience is first, followed by Skills and Education.
   - **Unnecessary Sections**: Flag any sections that detract from focus, such as personal information (photo, references, religion, etc.) or outdated objectives.
   - **Resume Length**: Verify the length is appropriate (1 page for under 10 years of experience, 2 pages for over 10 years).

3. **Font, Formatting, and Readability**:
   - **Font Consistency**: Ensure consistency in fonts, font sizes (10–12), and spacing. Suggest machine-readable fonts (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman) for ATS compatibility.
   - **White Space and Margins**: Confirm that there is sufficient white space and margins for readability, allowing easy annotation.
   - **Section Headers and Bullets**: Verify the correct use of section headers and bullet points for clear separation of information.

4. **Action-Oriented, Quantifiable Statements**:
   - **Impact-Focused Language**: Ensure each bullet point starts with an action verb and focuses on measurable accomplishments.
   - **Quantifiable Achievements**: Where possible, suggest specific metrics (e.g., increased efficiency by 20%) to enhance the impact of accomplishments.
   - **Elimination of Adverbs**: Recommend removing unnecessary adverbs (e.g., "effectively") and replacing them with quantifiable results.

5. **Technical and Relevant Skills**:
   - **Proficiency Levels**: Suggest adding proficiency levels (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert) for technical skills where applicable.
   - **Alignment with Job Market**: Check for trending technologies and skills (e.g., cloud computing, AI/ML) pertinent to software development roles in 2024.
   - **Keyword Optimization**: Assess the use of relevant keywords for ATS compatibility without excessive “keyword stuffing.”

6. **Education and Certifications**:
   - **Detail Completeness**: Verify each institution, degree, and graduation year are included. Ensure relevant certifications are up-to-date.
   - **GPA**: Suggest including GPA if above 3.0 and relevant. If using non-standard scales, recommend conversion to a 4.0 scale.

7. **Professional Summary and Objective**:
   - **Objective Omission**: Suggest omitting the objective section if present, focusing on a summary or headline instead.
   - **Professional Summary**: Evaluate whether the summary provides a concise overview of relevant skills, experience, and professional achievements.

8. **Project Experience and Portfolio Links**:
   - **Project Descriptions**: Check that project experience includes clear descriptions of technologies used, the candidate’s role, and project outcomes.
   - **Portfolio Accessibility**: Confirm that links to portfolios (e.g., GitHub, personal website) are included, functional, and professional.

9. **Formatting for ATS Compatibility**:
   - **File and Font**: Recommend saving as PDF with a simple, ATS-friendly font.
   - **Avoid Tables or Graphics**: Suggest removing tables or graphics that may interfere with ATS parsing.
